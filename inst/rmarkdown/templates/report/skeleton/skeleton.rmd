## Microbiome analytics tool

Reproducibilty is an essential aspect of data analysis. Especially for sequecing data for microbial community profilling. There are lack of standards to analysing and reporting data. This is mostly because there are simply some aspects of the data that we do not control. like which is the right choice of filtering, normalisation, transformation. In such cases it is important to have rational decision making and documenting it. Pre-processing is an essential step and in many instance is not given importance, as we biologists do not take these steps as seriously as it should be taken. To avoid this there are some common approaches to look at the data.  
1. How many reads/samples? if there is large difference this may affect the choices you make for alpha diversity, betadiversity and differential abundance testing.
2. How many reads/OTU ? this is aslo important to see of there are lot of OTUs with small mean & large coefficient of variation (C.V.).  

This tempate for microbiome data analysis, handling and visualisation. This makes it easy to follow some standard procedures for looking at your data and reporting you results. This first-hand look at your data will aid in making different choices for more thorough and in-dept investagion.   
You will need to install `microbiometemplate` document from github repo.

## Load libraries  

We have to load libraries click on the code tab on the left hand die of this doc for looking at the libraries that are installed. It is good to install these packages before.  
 

```{r load-libraries, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

library(microbiome)
library(microbiomeutilities)
library(microbiometemplate)
# install.packages("picante",repos="http://R-Forge.R-project.org") 
# library(picante)
library(picante)
library(data.table)

```

## Set project attributes  

Fill the details accordingly.  

**Project title** : Create a standard workflow for data reporting.  
**Main author** : Sudarshan A Shetty  
**contributor(s)** : XXXX  
**Principal Investigator (s)** : Hauke Smidt 
**Co-supervisor(s)** : XXXXX


The next code chunk is where you put all the parameters for analysis. This is the basis for your prelimanry analysis.  

```{r set-attributes}

otufile = "myBiom.biom"                     # input biom/shared/otutable as *csv file.
mapping = "myMapping.csv"                   # input mapping file in *.csv format.
taxonomy = NULL                             # taxonomy file in *.csv format.
treefilename = "myTree.tre"                 # tree file as *.tre and not *.tree.
type = "biom"                               # type of input either biom, mothur ..
                                            # .. or csv file as *.tre and not *.tree.
out_dir = "D:/Softwares/tes" #"F:/PATH/to/my/output/directory"  # path to the output directory.
VariableA = "MY_MainVariable"               # main variable of interest.
VariableB = "MY_SecondaryVariable"          # secondary variable of interest.
Distmethod = "bray"                         # choice of distance methods.
OrdinatMethod = "MDS"                       # choice of ordination methods.
filterCount = 4                             # Filter OTUs below this count number.
filterPrev = 0.01                           # filter parameter for OTUs, prevalence in dataset 0.01 = 1%.
col.palette = "Set2"                        # choice of color (RColorbrewer)
filterpseq = TRUE                           # filter phyloseq will be saved
samsize=NA                                  # rarefying depth

```

Check the code chunk next to this of left side to see folder names where files are stored. 

```{r setup-2, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
oripath <- getwd()
setwd(out_dir)
dir.create("QC")
dir.create("AlphaDiversity")
dir.create("BetaDiversity")
dir.create("Others")
dir.create("PhyloseqObjects")
```


## Initiate

This code chunk reads the input files and creates a phyloseq object. 

```{r initiate}

ps0 <- read_phyloseq(otu.file = otufile, 
                     metadata.file = mapping,
                     taxonomy.file = taxonomy, 
                     type = type)

tree <- read.tree(treefilename)

ps0 <- merge_phyloseq(ps0, tree)

saveRDS(ps0, "./PhyloseqObjects/ps_raw.rds")

message("Raw phyloseq object, confirm the number of samples and variables (as in columns of mapping file)")
message("Below is the content of raw phyloseqobject stored as ps_raw.rds")

print(ps0)

```


## QC {.tabset}

### Distribution of reads  

Check the library sizes for each of the samples within the main variable. Do you think it is okay or there is difference in library sizes and will this affect you downstream statistical analysis?  
```{r, qc-1}

qc_plot1 <- plot_ReadDistribution(ps0, groups = VariableB, 
    plot.type = "histogram")

ggsave("./QC/ReadDistribution.pdf")

message("QC plots for ReadDistribution stored in QC folder as ReadDistribution.pdf")

```

### Library sizes (barplot)  

```{r, qc-2}
message("Investigating library sizes")

barplot(sort(sample_sums(ps0)), horiz = TRUE, las = 2, sub = "Check if there is large differeence in library sizes")

```

### Library sizes (histogram)  

```{r, qc-3}

message("Investigating library sizes")

hist(sort(sample_sums(ps0)), las = 2, sub = "Check if there is large differeence in library sizes")

message("QC plots for library sizes stored in QC folder as LibrarySizePerSample.pdf")

pdf("./QC/LibrarySizePerSample.pdf")
barplot(sort(sample_sums(ps0)), horiz = TRUE, las = 2, sub = "Check if there is large differeence in library sizes")
hist(sort(sample_sums(ps0)), las = 2)
dev.off()

```


### OTU counts distribution (barplot)  

```{r qc-4}
message("Investigating OTU counts distribution")

barplot(sort(taxa_sums(ps0)), horiz = TRUE, las = 2, sub = "Check if there is large differeence in otu counts")

```

### OTU counts distribution (histogram)  

```{r qc-5}

message("Investigating OTU counts distribution")

hist(taxa_sums(ps0), las = 2, main = "raw")

pdf("./QC/Distribution_OTU_Counts.pdf")
barplot(sort(taxa_sums(ps0)), 
        horiz = TRUE, las = 2, 
        sub = "Check if there is large differeence in otu counts")
hist(taxa_sums(ps0), las = 2, main = "raw")
dev.off()

message("QC plots for library sizes stored in QC folder as Distribution_OTU_Counts.pdf")

```


```{r qc-6}
# for sanity
ps1 <- prune_taxa(taxa_sums(ps0) > 0, ps0)

```


### Variance (raw)  

This is variance for all OTU counts without filtering for min number of reads/OTU and prevalence.  

```{r qc-7}

Variance.plot.a <- qplot(log10(apply(otu_table(ps1), 1, var)), 
                         xlab = "log10(variance)",

print(Variance.plot.a)

ggsave("./QC/Variance before filtering.pdf")

message("QC plots for OTU variance stored in QC folder as Variance before filtering.pdf")

```


### Variance (filtered)  

This is variance for all OTU counts after filtering for min number of reads/OTU and prevalence. 

```{r qc-8}

if (filterpseq == TRUE) {
message(paste0("Filtering OTUs with less than ", filterCount, " counts"))
message(paste0("in at least ", filterPrev*100, " % of the samples "))

ps2 = filter_taxa(ps1, function(x) sum(x > filterCount) > (filterPrev * length(x)), TRUE)

message("Saving the transformed phyloseq object as ps_filtered.rds")

saveRDS(ps2, "./PhyloseqObjects/ps_filtered.rds")

                         xlab = "log10(variance)", 
                         main = "Variance in OTUs") + 
  ggtitle("after filtering") + 
  theme_minimal()

print(Variance.plot.b)
ggsave("./QC/Variance After filtering.pdf")

} else 
  {
    
    message("filterpseq was false. Did not filter and hence will not save the filtered phyloseq")
    
    ps2 <- ps1
    
}


```


## Measuring the kurtosis  

Kurtosis is essentially a measure of how much weight is at the tails of the distribution relative to the weight around the location.  
If you have large differences in your library sizes then you may have to normalise your data.

[Kurtosis](http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/eda35b.htm)  

```{r kurtosis}
  
message("Using the raw phyloseq to check for kurtosis in library size")

df <- data.table(NumberReads = sample_sums(ps0), SampleID = sample_names(ps0))
require(moments)
n <- kurtosis(df$NumberReads) 

if (n > 3) {
    message("Your library size is heavily tailed, considering normalising them for further analysis")
  }  else {
    
    message("The variation in library sizes is below kurtosis value of 3 may indicate no need for rarefying")
    
}
  
```

## Alpha diversity {.tabset}  

Alpha diversity measures are standard calculations in microbial ecology. The differences in richness and eveness between groups may have importance to understanding the ecology. There are numerous measures we use the defaults from `microbiome` R package and also the phylogenetic diversity from `picante`R package.  

The caculations can be done on rarefied or non-rarefied data which can be specified by the `samsize` option in "Set project attributes" option above.


### Non-phylogenetic diversity measures

## Barplot composition  {.tabset}   

Having a look at the phyloegnetic composition of you data is useful for many reasons. FOr this purpose we have two Phylum and Family level plots.

### Phylum  

```{r fig.height= 6, fig.width=14}

ps3.com <- ps3 # create a new pseq object
# We need to set Palette
taxic <- as.data.frame(ps3.com@tax_table)  # this will help in setting large color options

colourCount = length(unique(taxic$Phylum))  #define number of variable colors based on number of Family (change the level accordingly to phylum/class/order)
getPalette = colorRampPalette(brewer.pal(12, col.palette))  # change the palette as well as the number of colors will change according to palette.

# now edit the unclassified taxa
tax_table(ps3.com)[tax_table(ps3.com)[, "Phylum"] == "f__", "Phylum"] <- "f__Unclassified Phylum"
# We will also remove the 'f__' patterns for cleaner labels
tax_table(ps3.com)[, colnames(tax_table(ps3.com))] <- gsub(tax_table(ps3.com)[, 
    colnames(tax_table(ps3.com))], pattern = "[a-z]__", replacement = "")

otu.df <- as.data.frame(otu_table(ps3.com))  # make a dataframe for OTU information.
# head(otu.df) # check the rows and columns

taxic$OTU <- row.names.data.frame(otu.df)  # Add the OTU ids from OTU table into the taxa table at the end.
colnames(taxic)  # You can see that we now have extra taxonomy levels.

taxmat <- as.matrix(taxic)  # convert it into a matrix.
new.tax <- tax_table(taxmat)  # convert into phyloseq compaitble file.
tax_table(ps3.com) <- new.tax  # incroporate into phyloseq Object


# it would be nice to have the Taxonomic names in italics.
# for that we set this
guide_italics <- guides(fill = guide_legend(label.theme = element_text(size = 15, 
    face = "italic", colour = "Black", angle = 0)))


## Now we need to plot at family level, We can do it as follows:

# first remove the phy_tree

ps3.com@phy_tree <- NULL

ps3.com.phy <- aggregate_taxa(ps3.com, "Phylum")

ps3.com.phy.rel <- microbiome::transform(ps3.com.phy, "compositional")

plot.composition.relAbun.phy <- plot_composition(ps3.com.phy.rel) + theme(legend.position = "bottom") + 
    scale_fill_manual(values = getPalette(colourCount)) + theme_bw() + 
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) + 
  ggtitle("Relative abundance Phylum level") + guide_italics

      height = 8, width = 18)
}

```


### Family  

```{r fig.height= 6, fig.width=14}

colourCount = length(unique(taxic$Family))  #define number of variable colors based on number of Family (change the level accordingly to phylum/class/order)
getPalette = colorRampPalette(brewer.pal(12, col.palette))  # change the palette as well as the number of colors will change according to palette.
